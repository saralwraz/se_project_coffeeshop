# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

This site is for a coffee shop within the Triple Peaks Library where you can reserve a table, check out barista approved recipes, and more.
